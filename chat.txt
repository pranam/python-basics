Date: 2025-05-31

=== Initial Setup ===
1. Created project directory at /Users/pk/CascadeProjects/hello_world
2. Created basic hello.py with Hello World script
3. Created requirements.txt for Python dependencies

=== Python Examples ===
4. Added three example functions:
   - greet(name): String manipulation with f-strings
   - calculate_area(length, width): Basic math operations
   - is_even(number): Conditional logic with modulo operator

=== Git Setup ===
5. Created chat.txt to document progress
6. Attempted initial Git setup
7. Switched to GitHub setup

   - Generated new ED25519 SSH key
   - Added public key to GitHub account
   - Configured Git to use SSH
10. Successfully pushed code to GitHub repository

=== Current State ===
- All code is now version controlled on GitHub
- Project structure:
  - hello.py (with example functions)
  - requirements.txt
  - chat.txt

=== Next Steps ===
1. Continue adding more Python examples
2. Explore additional Python capabilities
3. Document new examples in this chat file

=== Technical Details ===
